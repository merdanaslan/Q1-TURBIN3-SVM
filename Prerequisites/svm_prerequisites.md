# Turbin3 SVM Focus: Q1 2025

## Focus Area: SVM API
I am focusing on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) API because of its critical role in powering decentralized trading systems, including DEXs and AMMs. My background in trading and interest in understanding the mechanics of perpetual swaps, bonding curves, and high-performance order matching make this area a perfect fit.

## What’s Happening in the SVM API?
The SVM API serves as the interface between smart contracts and Solana's runtime environment. It enables:
- **Parallel Transaction Execution**: Sealevel's execution engine allows multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously, provided they don’t conflict.
- **Efficient State Management**: Transactions include a list of all accounts they will interact with, which prevents race conditions and optimizes resource usage.
- **Program Interaction**: Through the API, smart contracts can interact with AMMs, liquidity pools, and order books, enabling decentralized and scalable financial primitives.
